"""Block plugin formatter: read all the scripts in a Scratch project file and output [scratchblocks] formatted code for Scratch forums/wiki.

    Usage: python block_plugin.py [path/to/project_file.sb]
"""

# Known block plugin bugs:
# - some booleans have to be encoded as reporters.
#      'touching?', 'touchingcolor?', 'coloristouching?', 'mousedown?',
#      'keypressed?'
#
# - Can't have spaces inside not block.
#     <not<(Current Type)=(Type)>>
#     <not<(a) = (b)>>
#
# - Can't have spaces in "mouse down?"
#     if <mouse down?>
#     
#
# - <(var) < (var)> gt & lt are really weird inside and, or, not, etc.
#     if <<<(x) > [-1]> and <(y) > [-1]>> and <<(x) < [20]> and <(y) < [14]>>>
#
# - Can't have empty dropdowns eg. broadcast [ v]
