Kurt is a Python library for reading/writing Scratch project (.sb) and sprite files.

So far, it can read/write sprites and their properties, including scripts, blocks, variables, and lists. It can read costumes and export them to separate image files. It can also export scripts to `scratchblocks` format for pasting into the Scratch forums/wiki.

You could use it for:

* converting to another format (like the `scratchblocks` converter does)
* generating Scratch projects using Python code
* analysing the scripts in a project
* *(someday, perhaps...)* making a "Scratch IDE" text-based editor for Scratch scripts... :)

(It *can't* write images as costumes or read/write sounds yet, but they're on the to-do list — see below)

**WARNING**: Make sure you take a backup of your Scratch projects before saving anything with kurt! kurt is by no means fully tested. I can't accept responsibility for corrupting your files.

If you're interested in technical details of how the format works: the code should be pretty self-documenting; but check out the documentation on the [Scratch wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_File_Format), which might be more readable...


## Installation

Download the latest version of Kurt and extract the `kurt` folder somewhere in your `sys.path` — or in the same directory as your code, if you prefer.

You'll need the **latest version** of the awesome [**Construct**](http://construct.wikispaces.com/) library — used for defining the format. It currently appears to be available [here](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/construct). (I'm using Construct version 2.04).

For saving images, you'll need the [**PyPNG**](https://code.google.com/p/pypng/) module. Kurt *should* work without it, if you don't want to save images — but it's strongly recommended.

Tested with **Python 2.6**. Works with **Scratch 1.4**; not tested with earlier versions, but possibly works.

[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) is created by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.


## Recent Changes 

###v1.3, decompiler:
* Images with depth `1` and `2` now work — (fixed some buggy reverse-engineered code).

###v1.2, images:
* Can now parse images! :D

	Well, most images. If not, try reloading the project with Scratch and saving it again — this sometimes helps.
	
	Unfortunately, Kurt doesn't compress the images when saving them back to the file again (yet), so it may massively increase your file size :P Again, you can just open it in Scratch and save it again, and the file size will be back to normal.

* Split Sprite.media into separate costumes/sounds lists.

###v1.1, scripts:

* `Script` and `Block` classes for manipulating scripts.
* **Block plugin** formatter — reads all the scripts in a project file and outputs `[scratchblocks]` syntax code for posting on the Scratch forums/wiki.
* Filled out the `_fields` list for most of the objects in `user_objects` from the Squeak source (not the unused ones), so there should now be no "undefined" fields.
* `Color` is now parsed correctly
* Added `ScratchProjectFile.sprites` shortcut as an alias for `project.stage.sprites`


## Usage

Here's a quick getting started — grab a Python interpreter (Python's `>>>` prompt — just type `python` into your terminal, or load up IDLE), and have a go!

You'll probably just want to use the provided `ScratchProjectFile` and `ScratchSpriteFile` classes. Load them by passing the path to the file to their constructor and use their provided `.save()` methods.

You can import just these classes them using:

    from kurt.files import *

Load a file (you'll find a preview file, `game.sb`, saved in the `tests` directory; but feel free to try it with any Scratch project file).

	# Just pass in the absolute or relative path to the file:
	project = ScratchProjectFile("tests/game.sb")
	
    # You can reload the file at any time with .load()

Inspect project:

    project.info['author'] # u'blob8108'
    project.stage # <ScratchStageMorph(Stage)>
    
    # List fields on object:
    project.stage.fields.keys() # ['volume', 'hPan', 'sprites', 'lists', 'vars', 'obsoleteSavedState', 'color', 'media', 'sceneStates', 'bounds', 'submorphs', 'zoom', 'isClone', 'blocksBin', 'flags', 'objName', 'owner', 'tempoBPM', 'vPan', 'properties', 'costume']

    # Access fields using dot notation:
    project.stage.tempoBPM # 60
    project.stage.sprites # OrderedCollection([<ScratchSpriteMorph(ScratchCat)>])
    
    cat = project.stage.sprites[0]
    cat.name # u'ScratchCat'

Most of the objects you're interested in, like `ScratchStageMorph` and `ScratchSpriteMorph`, inherit from `UserObject`. You can use `.fields.keys()` to see the available fields on one of these objects.

`FixedObjects` like `OrderedCollection` have a `.value` property to access their value.

Inline objects, such as `int` and `bool`, are converted transparently to their Pythonic counterparts. `Array` and `Dictionary` are converted to `list` and `dict`, too. 

Make changes:

    cat.vars # {u'vx': 0.0}
    cat.vars['vx'] = 100

Save:

    project.save()

Now re-open the project with Scratch!

Everything should, of course, work perfectly; if you have any problems, please file an issue, and I'll take a look! (:

### Scripts
A list of scripts can be found on the `scripts` property of both sprites and the stage.

    >>> cat.scripts
    [Script(Point(23, 36.0),
	Block('EventHatMorph', 'Scratch-StartClicked'),
	Block('xpos:', 0),
	Block('doForever',  [
			Block('doIf', 
				Block('keyPressed:', 'right arrow'),
				[
					Block('changeVariable', u'vx', <#changeVar:by:>, 2),
				]),
			Block('doIf', 
				Block('keyPressed:', 'left arrow'),
				[
					Block('changeVariable', u'vx', <#changeVar:by:>, -2),
				]),
			Block('changeVariable', u'vx', <#setVar:to:>, 
				Block('*', 
					Block('readVariable', u'vx'),
				0.80000000000000004),
			),
			Block('changeXposBy:', 
				Block('readVariable', u'vx'),
			),
		]))]

Use the `to_block_plugin` method to print them nicely:

    >>> print cat.scripts[0].to_block_plugin()
    when green flag clicked
    set x to (0)
    forever
        if <key [right arrow v] pressed?>
            change [vx v] by (2)
        end
        if <key [left arrow v] pressed?>
            change [vx v] by (-2)
        end
        set [vx v] to ((vx) * (0.8))
        change x by (vx)
    end

This is identical to `scratchblocks` format, so you can paste them straight into the Scratch forums or wiki.

You'll find a script for automatically exporting all the scripts in a project file to `scratchblocks` format under `util/block_plugin.py`. Just pass it the path to your project file. For example:

    python util/block_plugin.py tests/game.sb

### Images
You can find costumes under a sprite's `costumes` property (similarly for stage `backgrounds`).

    cat.costumes # [<ImageMedia(costume1)>, <ImageMedia(costume2)>]
    image = cat.costumes[0]

Save to an external file:

    image.save("scratch_cat.png")

There's a script under `util/export_images.py` for exporting all the costumes in a Scratch project to separate files, with a folder for each sprite. It automatically makes a folder with the name `<project name> files` to put the images in. Again, just pass it the path to your project.

    $ python util/export_images.py tests/game.sb 
    $ ls "tests/game files"
    ScratchCat
    $ ls "tests/game files/ScratchCat"
    costume1.png	costume2.png

## Licence

Kurt is released under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl) Version 3 (or any later version).

I'm not a lawyer; but I _think_ this means while you can use Kurt in your own, non-GPL'd code, any Kurt modifications must be distributed under the (L)GPL and include the source code. _(This is not legal advice and does not affect the terms as stated in the licence...)_


## Todo

* <s>Parse images</s> DONE! :D
	* Compress Bitmap to ByteArray on save (using run-length encoding)
	* Images with depth `16` are not supported *(need an example)*
	* Default color values — `squeak_colors` *(need an example)*

* Import images from a separate `.png` or `.jpg` file and save them into a Scratch file.

* Make some decent tests

* Read/write external Sound files

* "Default project" for building projects entirely "from scratch" (as it were) in Python code?

* Optimise `ObjectNetworkAdapter` for building large files.	

	Kurt is currently very quick at parsing files; but pretty slow at writing them, particularly ones with very long scripts.

* Optimise image parsing.
